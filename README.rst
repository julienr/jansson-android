jansson for Android
==================
This is a repackaging of libzip for the Android NDK.

The only changed files are config.h and the android .mk files.

Jansson's homepage is : http://www.digip.org/jansson/

Assuming 'ndk-build' is in your path, you can use the build.sh script to build a static lib.
